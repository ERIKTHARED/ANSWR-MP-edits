EVTNAME52036;The Grand Opening of the Bilderberg Tavern;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52036;Today marks the day for the long awaited the opening of the Bilderberg Tavern.  Although a tavern in name, it is actually a large hotel. The architecture is stunning, with a façade including different motifs and patterns. Bero van Lipsterveld, a prominent statesman and the biggest sponser of the hotel, declares he is delighted with the opening. Van Lipsterveld states: The Bilderberg Tavern is a symbol to bring people and nations together. However there are conspiracies that claim the hotel will be used for unsavoury meetings by important people wearing goat-masks.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT52036OPTA;A glorious day for $COUNTRY$ !;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME52037;Statesman eaten... Again?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52037;The nation is in shock. At the Bilderberg Tavern a body has been reported dead. Or rather eaten. After identifying the body, it belonged to noneother than Bero van Lipsterveld, the controversial statesman. He had been kidnapped and eaten by a group of people during one of his nightwalks. A bunch of symbols and a stained letter was left behind in his stomach. With regard to the conspiracies, this certainly was a political statement.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT52037OPTA;Those bloody communists!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT52037OPTB;Those bloody fascists!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT52037OPTC;Business as usual;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME52039;Kouderhagen Offers To Buy Their Former Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52039;Founded in 2462, by the legendary explorer Wellen Bloem, Nieuw-Kouderhagen became the most successful overseas colony under the Koudrel Crown. Due to its proximity to our nation, just off the coast of Terre-Neuve, there were multiple attempts at taking Nieuw-Kouderhagen. We, though unfortunately unsuccesful, manage to create discussion with Kouderhagen, and ended up purchasing the colony off of them in 2542. Kouderhagen now wants to buy back the region, after nearly 300 years. While it's still inhabited by many ancestors of the original colonists, it has become a major part of Quebec, holding the entrance to Cabot Strait, making it strategically key to defending from a naval attack. They are offering a large amount of money, so it makes sense to consider the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA52039;Their offer is good enough for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB52039;They sold their right to Nieuw-Kouderhagen in 2542;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME52040;Quebec Accepts Our Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52040;After considering our offer, Quebec has accepted, granting us control of the island of Nieuw-Kouderhagen, and Zittend en Kade. It has been far too long, many celebrating in the streets of Bloemstad.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA52040;It is a day to celebrate with our long lost brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME52041;Quebec Rejects Our Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52041;After considering our offer, Quebec has declined, stating that they are in a well enough monetary situtation, to hold off on recklessly selling one of their territories. While many in Nieuw-Kouderhagen wish to rejoin the Kingdom, they are chained to Quebec.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA52041;We can dream of a day when they are free of the Quebecois.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME52042;The Vlanish Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52042;After Decades of surpression under Koudenhagen the vlanish finally have had enough and choose to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52025;The History of Kouderhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52025;"Led by the van Kampoen dynnasty, this nation has rebuild itself faster than others. Willem VII van Kampioen was the man with the idea of shaping a confederation with the surrounding lands, after delving into ancient texts in the libraries of Kouderhagen. He formed this confederation with the German lands and called Oudrijk. After a long while, many rising nations like Austria, Bavaria and Brandenburg, were disappointed in the inability of Kouderhagen to lead The Oudrijk. Thus Kouderhagen was forced to leave The Oudrijk. Now, Kouderhagen is the most developed nations in Europe.  The current Koudrel king, Lunnes II, finds his allies in the east at the Bohemian branch of the van Kampioens and Elsass-Loraine. Now with more enemies than friends, Lunnes II looks to the seas.";;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52026;The History of Patagonia;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52026;Before the Platinean conquest, a communal system was held in Patagonia. Patagonia was stateless, moneyless but somehow still prosperous. Having been under Platinean rule for the past two centuries, the people of Patagonia want to forge their own path. Longing for a system where they can keep their ancient communal system combined with the use of money, laws and an organised state. Their independence war was a bloody one, leaving many dead. At the battle at Zapifa they succesfully victored over the Platineans. This marked the beginning of La Patagonia's Commune, and independent state. ;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52027;The History of the La Platan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52027;The floods were devastating for Argentina. Many people were killed and in many regions it was even impossible to cultivate the land. The Argentinans tried to escape the floods by going north and eastwards, though some remained on the Isla del Plata island, where vegatation grew and allowed them to live.  In Chile the people went westwards settling prosperous city states. These city-states decided to expand to the fertile lands in the west and south These areas were too weak to defend and were easily captured by the new nation of La Plata a union of these city-states. Because of hard repression the Patagonians eventually revolted, breaking free from the Republic of La Plata. The republic of La Plata has potential but has to be careful for their powerful northern neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52028;The History of the Quycan Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52028;"This ""Kingdom of the Earth"", as it is known in the language,  is the home for Muiscan and Carribean people. This kingdom encompasses what used to be Colombia, Venezuela and the Guianas. Though the countries are unified under one banner,  the rebellions, longing for their own nations-state, have not stopped. In the meantime the Quycan Kingdom rules absloute over her people,  trying to keep the kingdom together. It is only a of leadership to keep the country together and withstand external influences.";;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52029;The History of the Cuscan Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52029;When the floods happened, Lima's large population moved away seeking resources. The new settlements quickly became a source of problems due to racial issues. Ramón Cuevas led the white supremacist faction claiming the Empire of Perú, whilst the indigenous claimed the Cusco Kingdom. A civil war led out but quickly turned into a stalemate, leading to a ceasefire. In the meanwhile the Cuscans developed rapidly, whilst the Peruvians remained in a rural lifestyle. At a final war the Peruvians lost having to cede all their territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52030;The History of Buliwiya;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52030;La Paz's population did not face the same problems as other big cities in Latin America, like having water shortages. As the centuries passed, La Paz remained under an everlasting social, technological and cultural regression. As time went by the resourcces in La Paz started going scarce. Multiple factions started popping up in La Paz fighting for food and other life-needs. One man, Cristo Morales stood up against these factions and restored order back in La Paz. He already had built up the reputation among the people. Later on the people started to crown him as King Cristo I. King Christo I has unified the lands in peaceful ways under the banner of the Buliwya Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC52032;After the collapse of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro a massive exodus happend. These two cities clashed against each other multiple times. After some time passed, these people formed two feudal-like kingdoms. The Janeirans formed the kingdom of Terrablanca and the Sao-paolese formed the kingdom of Corleste. Many costfull wars were fought for fertile lands, and eventually King Francisco of Corleste won over Terrablanca. But in reality he was on his way to lose power, since he was also planning to take over the power that the Serene Senate of Terrablanca held. The senate with help of the Janeiran army manage to defeat King Francisco of Corleste when he was marching on to ;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME52024;The History of The Flanspublyk;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC52024;After Kouderhagen was forced to leave the Oudrijk in 2693, they were still allowed to send colonists and merchants to the northern parts of the Empire. Over time the colonists intermingled and even outnumbered the Germans living in the area.Having merged with the Frisian tongues, the colonists found themselves being in culturally isolated from the rest of the Oudrijk. Being sponsored by Kouderhagen, the Flanspublyk chose to pursue independence. Having the backing of experienced generals from Kouderhagen, and being severely underestimated by the Austrians, the Flanisch won decisively, freeing themselves from the grasp of the Oudrijk by 2764. However good relations would only last so long with Kouderhagen, as the Flanspublyk soon found itself surrounded by those wishing to see it under its belt.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT52024OPTA;Interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME53000;The History of Norkselskap I;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC53000;Founded in 2709, in Bergen, during the peak of Norge-Svea, by Edvin Aas. The Norkselskap was given permission by the Crown to sail to Africa and trade along the coast.  When things took a turn, and Aas found himself shipwrecked on the shores of the Bakongo penisula, he was taken in by those living there. He struck a deal, giving his company a small piece of land on the coast for future endeavors. Overtime this piece of land became known as Tipsbyen, developing quickly into a city. The Norkselskap became the jewel of Norge-Svea, attracting thousands upon thousands of those from the homeland. Establishing its self on the strait that controlled the entrance to the Kongo and Chad seas, money was quickly piling up within Norkselskap.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT53000OPTA;Intresting...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME53001;The History of Norkselskap II;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC53001;By 2800, Norkselskap would find itself controlling the entire Bakongo penisula. However, soon enough, it would find it's homeland of Norge-Svea attacked, and almost wiped off the earth by the coalition of Scotland and Copenhagen, now Skandinaviska, by September 3rd, 2826. Norge-Svea, now reeling from the blow, saw fit to grant the company independce, as Norge-Svea wouldn't be able to support the colony any longer. A referendum was held among the wealthiest citizens, in 2827, deciding upon a republic as their desired form of government. Now Norkselskap must find its own path among the nations of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT53001OPTA;Intresting...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME51000;The History of Skandinaviska;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC51000;It was only recently that Skandinaviska became known as such. Previously known as Copenhagen, a small city state controlling the straits of the Oresund, it won the lower half of Skandinaviska on September 3rd, of 2826, the signing of the Treaty of Bergen, after a brutal war against Norge-Svea, with Scotland. After the fourten years of war, Copenhagen grew accustomed to the new wave of unity with their relatives on the mainland began referring to their nation as Skandinaviska. Seeing this new wave among his people, Amberson III, in the hereditary position of leader, decided to hold a coronation, and become King of Skandinaviska in 2832, under the general consensus of the population, at age 79. Skandinaviska's ambition knows no bounds, yet the new player has barely received any recognition from its European neighbors. It's no secret that they wouldn't mind creating that recognition from their force.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT51000OPTA;Intresting...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME51001;The History of Norge-Svea;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC51001;Long past it's glory days, Norge-Svea now awaits its end in the blistering wastes of northern Skandinaviska. It's unclear when Norge-Svea was formed, but it is thought to have been created in a similar vain to Kouderhagen, during the legendary era of The Storm. Once able to claim the entirety of Skandinaviska island, and boast a jewel of a colony in the form of the Norkselskap in Africa. Whether it be incompetence, badluck, or both, they now must survive the oncoming hordes from Copenhagen, and maybe get a little bit of revenge along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME51002;The History of Cislavet;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC51002;A result of the Koudrel Conquests into Deutsch, Cislavet was created as a aristocratic duchy within what became the Oudrijk when it was still controlled by the Koudrel Kings. Cislavet slowly grew in strength within the Oudrijk, becoming one of its most loyal vassals. This loyalty was rewarded by the Koudrels, and they soon began sharing the same dynasty after multiple marriages. However, after the War of the Cross, and the Oudrijk's defeat to the Schweiz-Pakt in 2692 , many Duestch nobles began blaming Kouderhagen, eventually demanding them to leave the Oudrijk. Now without their connection to their crown, Cislavet began to act more rebelliously within the Oudrijk, forming the Oppostion faction in the Oudrijk with Jungfeld, another supporter of the Koudrels. With the new innovations brought with the rise of Industrialization, Cislavet is ready to challenge the Fernosters and their grip on the Oudrijk.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT51002OPTA;Intresting...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME51003;The History of Fernost;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC51003;Originally an administrative region of the Oudrijk, it became home to the von Gesegnet dynasty, an influential noble family  hailing from Kouderstad with Deutsch orgins, who were close to Willem III of Kouderhagen during his famous Conquests of the Plains. After being granted the lands of Fernost, they built the strongest region within the Oudrijk, gaining the influence to kick the Koudrels out of the Oudrijk, the very people who formed it, out of political and military blunders during the War of the Cross in 2692, with Fernost leadership blaming Kouderhagen for the defeat againist the Schweiz-Pakt. Under the leadership of Erik I, Fernost was able to take the crown of the Oudrijk, making Erik I, the first Fernost Kaizer in the Oudrijk, and first Kaizer not of the Von Kampioen dynasty. Former loyal subjects to the previous rulers, such as Bohemia and Jungfeld, have formed a faction within the Oudrijk to block Fernost interests within it, acting more and more rebellious each year, the young Kaizer Reginald I must find a balance within his domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME51004;The History of The Union of the Stales;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC51004;Named after the great city of New Stales, The Union of the Stales was a nation formed on the Island of England in 2378, by the local city-states around New Stales in the Southeast of England. Under the democratic leadership of New Stales, the wealthy prospered, trading between its neighbors, and those across the straits, such as Pars, and Kouderhagen. These traders were frequently in conflict with pirates from Anglia, an island just off the coast of the Unionist country. As pirating increased during the early 28th century, New Stales was fed up, and declared war upon the Anglians in 2741. Despite clear numerical advantages, New Stales failed to win almost any naval battle against the more agile Anglian ships. As a result, The Union lost its north-eastern territories to the Anglians, and stopped expanding, eventually halting almost all imports and exports. With the economy halted, some began experimenting with production, causing a slow industrialization process within the country. Now with a chugging industry, The Union of the Stales looks to bolster its trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC60168006;Reports came in today that street lights and lines in $PROVINCENAME$ have been badly damaged during the skirmishes that happened with enemy troops. Lines and poles have been hit by artillery fire, damaged by bullets or had the supply purposely cut, the poles dug and knocked down in an attempt to turn the fight in their favor and hide their position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME60168005;Sabotage in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC60168005;A locomotive hurriedly passed by the $PROVINCENAME$ railroad during dusk while human silhouettes snuck out of the railroad. They hit the wooden keys used to hold the rails in chairs with a hammer, diverting the train to a more sinuous track while forward other figures moved objects in the rail. The train was wrecked by putting objects on the high rail at a curve, and contained tons of supplies for our troops fighting in the province. Later on that night, one of our railroad bridges in $PROVINCENAME$ was burned to the ground, with no culprits found. These actions are believed to be the work of the enemy and severely crippled our railroad network.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC60168004;Bullets whistled as the morning came in $PROVINCENAME$. Enemy soldiers engaged our troops in the roads, their drums hoaring in the distance. Our local fort was spearheading the defense, soldiers taking turns crouching to reload and standing up to fire at the enemies. A group of enemy saboteurs snuck in one of the fort walls and managed to blew it up with explosives, severely damaging the fort's structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	###Uncivilized Country Events###

EVTNAME13000;Wind of Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13000;Once the wind of Western civilization blows to the East, every blade of grass and every tree in the East follow what the Western wind brings.'\n\nWe call them omens, the strange things that have transpired lately. Off our coastlines, strange ships have begun appearing. Strange ships, with masts so tall as to seem to touch the face of God. At first a curiosity, soon every so often -- increasing in intensity as gale grows to storm -- and tomorrow? Strange are their ships, and stranger still their customs, but there can be no doubt that we must adopt a policy with regards to the foreigners from 'Europe'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13000;We will allow the westerners into $COUNTRY$, so long as they cause no trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13000;They bring dangerous ideas. $COUNTRY$ will refuse them all access.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13010;Shipwrecked Sailors;Les naufragés;Schiffsbrüchige Matrosen;;Marineros naufragados;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13010;An old pond\nA frog jumps in —\nThe sound of water.'\n-- Matsuo Basho\nOne of our coastal provinces is bustling with rumors about the strange people who were found along its shorelines earlier this morning. The more precise origin of these shipwrecked sailors is as of yet uncertain, but, wherever they are from, they are definitely not from $COUNTRY$. The difficulty now lies in deciding what to do with them: if we send them home, we are effectively changing our policy of non-interaction with the westerners. Ignoring them and allowing them to stay, however, means permitting a western presence in $COUNTRY$ despite all our efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13010;Send them home.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13010;Allow them to stay.;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13015;Foreign Smugglers;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13015;One of our subjects has been discovered wearing foreign clothes, and further interrogation by the authorities has lead to the slow unraveling of a foreign smuggling ring. These foreigners come into $COUNTRY$ without permission, knowing they face execution should they be caught-- yet some of our advisors say there are benefits to their presence, as they can supply needs to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people that we cannot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13015;They are welcome to stay.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13015;Go home!;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13016;Smugglers Sell Opium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13016;In what should come as no surprise, the foreign smuggling ring in one of our provinces has been caught red-handed selling opium to the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13016;Shut down the ring immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13016;Do whatever it takes to eliminate this menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13020;Foreign Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13020;Despite our policy of not permitting foreigners into $COUNTRY$, it has been discovered that a group of foreign missionaries has been traveling among our people and spreading their religion. While we have every right to execute them out of hand, this does raise the possibility of a confrontation with their home country. Do we wish to risk such a war, all for the sake of a few priests?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13020;Ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13020;Round them up and execute them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13021;Missionaries Executed in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13021;We have received reports that a number of our missionaries have been executed in $FROMCOUNTRY$, part of a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ action to round up all unwanted foreigners. The missionaries were peaceful, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public is understandably enraged. Many believe that war is necessary, while others believe the potential for war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ simply isn't worth it. The missionaries knew they were not permitted in $FROMCOUNTRY$, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13021;This cannot be permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13021;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13030;Western Approaches;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13030;News reaches us that an expatriate community of foreigners, from various European countries and Great Powers, has formed in one of our cities. Doubtlessly, this is a direct effect of our government's policy of open ports and borders. This influx might be positive, as our government seems to believe, however some voices have less kind things to say about the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13030;They are welcome to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13030;Send them home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13031;Grievous Insults!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13031;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who left $COUNTRY$ some time ago on an expedition to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been viciously refused entry to the country. It appears that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has turned gradually to a policy of increasing isolationism, most likely in order to avoid the pains of modernizing their political, economical and social institutions. This policy of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is, obviously, impairing the advances of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ trade, diplomacy and missionary activities in the region, and must be considered an unjust restriction of the international freedom of movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13031;Force of arms must be considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13031;We must respect and tolerate the differences between our respective cultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13040;Foreign Trading Post?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our isolationist policies, some amounts of foreign trade goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in $PROVINCENAME$, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the overall intactness of our policy of separateness from the world outside $COUNTRYNAME$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might creep into our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13040;Keep it small. Keep it simple. Keep it under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13040;Hmm. No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13050;Opium Habit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13050;A sweet, pungent stench hangs over the backstreets and alleys in $PROVINCENAME$, emanating and spreading in every direction from an epicenter at the foreign trade station. The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13050;It is not our place to intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13050;Issue an edict banning the sale of opium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC13050;Close the trade station;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13051;Smugglers Dodge Trade Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13051;Due to the trade restrictions on the sale of opium, a number of western merchants have instead gone underground. We have word that a group of them have set up shop in one of our coastal provinces, but so far none of the locals seem willing to come forth with information. If we allow the smuggling ring to remain, it seems only a matter of time before the opium problem spreads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13051;Ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13051;Do whatever it takes to uproot them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13055;Use of Opium Spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13055;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell. Wherever there is an unexposed harbor, a foreign ship soon docks, and drives another fang into our national body. The use of opium has spread to $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13055;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13060;It is not our place to intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13060;Use of Opium spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13060;The use of opium in a neighboring province has now spread to the inland. Farmers and laborers in $PROVINCENAME$ fail to turn up for work, and entire fields fall fallow, as the people of $PROVINCENAME$ slip further and further down into the mists of consuming dependence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC13061;The use of opium in a neighboring province has now spread to the inland. Farmers and laborers throughout $STATENAME$ fail to turn up for work, and entire fields fall fallow, as the people slip further and further down into the mists of consuming dependence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13065;The Governor Sends a Letter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13065;We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li from $COUNTRY$. Yet there are barbarian ships that strive to come here for trade for the purpose of making a great profit. The wealth of $COUNTRY$ is used to profit the barbarians. By what right do they then in return use the poisonous drug to injure the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people?'\n\nOne of our governors has taken the opium problem into his own hands, and written a letter to a foreign head of state, questioning the morality of their support of the opium trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13065;That's the spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13065;No! Apologize and stop this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13080;Losing Face;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13080;He hides his face and speaks with controlled anger. A local aristocrat in $PROVINCENAME$ has been insulted by one of the foreigners living there. Apparently, the foreigner in question failed to bow in the appropriate manner when passing the aristocrat on the street. Shall we tolerate such blatant ignorance of our customs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13080;The foreigner is ignorant, not malevolent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13080;Perhaps some gold could make things better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC13080;Expel the foreigners!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13090;Microscope Imported;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13090;He unveils the device with the excitement of a child. - 'You can see their eyes!', he cries, pointing excitedly at the jar of beetles. He instructs you to look into the object -- the glass and metal is cold against your face -- there, in curves of an optic lens, reality is magnified ten times over. - 'It's a microscope!, he laughs. - 'I bought it from one of the foreigners in $PROVINCENAME$!';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13090;Our research will blossom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13100;Anti-foreign revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13100;The foreigners have gone too far! Their missionaries spread false teachings, subverting our people and our national unity, they break our customs and their opium clouds our minds. At least that is the message you will get if you ask the people in $PROVINCENAME$ where an anti-foreign revolt has just broken out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13100;Oh darn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13110;A Western Education?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13110;We have decided to open our doors to the West, and if we expect our subjects to embrace this policy, it becomes important that we ourselves, the Royal family, set good examples. Well educated leaders will be absolutely essential if we are to fully take our rightful place in the court of nations, and by sending our progeny abroad for education in Europe, or by hiring Westerners to educate them here, we can accomplish just that. What say you, your majesty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13110;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13120;The King and I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13120;The European governess we have hired to educate the court seems to be doing fairly well at her job, but she has been introducing some rather strange ideas around the place. For instance, she has been throwing around, in quite harsh language, the idea that all men are created equal, and that $COUNTRY$ should abolish the time-honored institution of slavery. I don't know, your majesty, this sounds like dangerous stuff...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13120;Enjoy the conversations, but ultimately do nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13120;Dangerous or not, I believe she is right;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13130;European Military Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13130;One of the Great Powers of the West has taken an interest in our country, and has offered to establish a military mission. While this might be beneficial to our research, it might also prove a liability in the event of war, however, turning down such a generous offer might be perceived as somewhat of an insult. Do we wish to allow the establishment of a military mission?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13130;Certainly! Our troops need to modernize;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13130;I think we can manage without it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13140;Military Intelligence Spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13140;Some intelligence concerning our military preparations has spread from the military mission in $PROVINCENAME$, severely hurting our war effort. We have expelled the members of the mission, but the damage has already been done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13140;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13150;Europeans Harassed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13150;The high militancy among certain parts of the population in $PROVINCENAME$ has lead to an outbreak of violence directed at local expatriate foreigners. The embassies of the Great Powers have all lodged formal diplomatic complaints with our government, and seem to expect some sort of action on our part. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13150;Ignore them;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13150;Round up the usual suspects;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13160;What shall we do with the drunken sailor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13160;Sailors winding up drunk in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ prisons aren't normally affairs of state, but this is an exception. A navyman from one of the Great Powers has been arrested by officials in $PROVINCENAME$, after having murdered one of our subjects in what appears to have started as a bar fight. The diplomatic attach?insists that the sailor be handed over to the country in question, and tried according to their laws. This presents us with a conundrum. Granting this privilege once is tantamount to allowing extraterritoriality to all foreign subjects, but not doing so might very well cause international uproar. This issue merits careful consideration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13160;Hand him over to the foreigners;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13160;Execute him;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13170;$FROMCOUNTRY$ executes sailor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13170;A depesch has arrived from our attach?in $FROMCOUNTRY$, detailing the tragedy of a sailor in our merchant marine. Apparently, the sailor killed a local in a scuffle during an extended shore leave in $FROMPROVINCE$. Despite pressures from our diplomatic mission, he was later tried and executed according to $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ laws. While we mourn his passing, we should also take some time to consider what we should do about this grave and serious insult to our national honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13170;Dispatch a punitive expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13170;Drink the bitter chalice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13180;$FROMCOUNTRY$ grants extraterritoriality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13180;News reaches us from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have decided to allow foreigners to be tried according to the laws of their native countries. Doubtlessly caused by pressure from within the circles of the Great Powers, these are good news nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13180;We are pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13185;An Invitation Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13185;A group of western expatriates currently residing in $CAPITAL$ have offered an invitation to high-ranking members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to attend a fancy affair in the legation quarter. We're well aware that this is just an excuse for these men to gain more influence in $COUNTRY$ -- but there could be benefits for us as well, namely using the opportunity to gain insight into their methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13185;Attend the function.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13185;Refuse. We don't need their methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13186;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13186;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepreneurs recently spent time plying $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials with fine wine and favors at a formal affair in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s legation quarter. The result is promising -- a number of new business ventures and trade deals, giving $COUNTRY$ greater sway over $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ affairs. All these men require is our government's support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13186;We'll gladly support this initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13186;They have our permission to continue, but we can offer no support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC13186;This is not in our best interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13190;Military Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13190;With the European presence in our part of the world steadily increasing, the need for military reform becomes more dire every day. Where the Europeans field regiments of drilled professionals, we meet them with an army that is old and outdated, and organised along the lines of clan, family, nobility and personal loyalties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13190;Reform the military;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13190;We will not abandon our traditional ways;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13200;Our Master's Voice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13200;We have suffered a defeat. Despite our policy of splendid isolation, a hostile world has made inroads into ours. $SPHEREMASTER$ has forced our country open, and the gravitation of their might and power has brought our political life into orbit around theirs. Foreign traders, missionaries and spies pour across our borders, all the while undermining our traditional sovereignty over this, our homeland. No longer the masters of our own fate, our first priority now is to obey. But some dark night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13200;We bide our time;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13200;Liberty or Death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13202;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13202;Our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have worsened to the point that members of their government have begun a campaign to reduce or even eliminate $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence. Some of our diplomats have fled, and now we are faced with the unpleasant prospect of either enforcing our interests or suffering embarrassment at our inability to manage a former ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13202;We will defend our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13202;We will not go to war over this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13210;Rescript on Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13210;So shall ye not only be Our good and faithful subjects, but render illustrious the best traditions of your forefathers.'\n\n$COUNTRYNAME$'s educational system is deeply mired in ancient tradition and long-established dogma. While it has helped maintain the traditional order in eras past, the old system has a hard time integrating the new knowledge that is spreading from the civilized nations of the west. By reforming the system we risk upsetting the vested interests of the traditionalists, but can we afford not to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13210;Push for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13210;The old ways endure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13220;Legation Quarter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13220;Several of the Great Powers have in the past few years sought to establish formalized and permanent embassies in $COUNTRYNAME$, but up until now we've turned down their proposals. However, an idea has been floating around the capital that we should perhaps allow them to set up these embassies after all, provided they are all kept in one place where we can exact some amount of control over them. Perhaps a Legation Quarter in $PROVINCENAME$ could be just the thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13220;They'd better appreciate this;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13220;Why? They have nothing to offer us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13230;Ambassador Killed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13230;Wandering alone in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ can be a dangerous thing, as a foreign ambassador in the Legation Quarter recently found out. Guards report having found him dead at 4 a.m. in the morning, apparently the victim of a robbery, however the foreigners accuse us of having failed in our supposed responsibility to protect their diplomats. We fear that even a formal apology will not be enough to placate them, however, something more tangible might...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13230;Grudgingly erect a monument to the diplomat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13230;Apologize, but leave it at that;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC13230;This is nonsense, he put himself in harm's way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13280;Aristocrats Angered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13280;The reforms sweeping through our country have upset the landed elites in $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13280;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13290;100 Days of Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13290;Our defeat in the last war has left us with the clear realization that certain things within our country need to adapt to the realities of the new world, and a quick campaign of reform could bring us up to speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13290;Major reform!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13290;Minor reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90950;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Nationalization Program;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90950;In these decisive days in the history of mankind, these days in which truth struggles to have itself recognized in the international chaos where powers of evil domination and imperialism have prevailed, $FROMCOUNTRY$ stands firmly to preserve its sovereignty and its dignity against imperialistic schemes of a number of nations who have uncovered their desires for domination and supremacy. In these days and in such circumstances $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resolved to show the world that when nations decide to preserve their sovereignty, they will do that all right and that when these nations are fully determined to defend their rights and maintain their dignity, they will undoubtedly succeed in achieving their ends.\nA spokesperson of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government announced the nationalization of all foreign investments in the country. Great Powers and investors demonstrated their outrage at their decision and some in our own government are calling for harsh measures to set an example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA90950;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ investments need to be protected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB90950;We respect $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	### Great Powers###

EVTNAME19000;Great Power Contention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19000;Our independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted between several great powers each vying for dominance over our government. If any of them attempts to assert themselves in $COUNTRY$, it will mean conflict with our government, the other great powers, and possibly even war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19000;Good news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19005;Tensions in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19005;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted in $FROMCOUNTRY$ over the issue of criminal investigations. Our position is that we have the right to conduct our own criminal investigations in $FROMCOUNTRY$, without interference from local or foreign authorities. This position is obviously contested by our rivals. Our choice here is to either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ independence, or fall back, which means losing influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19005;Assert our position;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19005;Fall back;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19010;A Place In The Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19010;Our nation is one of the most prestigious Great Powers on Earth. From $CAPITAL$ to far flung provinces beyond, our flag flutters proudly in the winds, striking fear into the hearts of anyone who dare oppose us. In celebration of our dominance and just reign, an imperial parade is being planned in $CAPITAL$. The question that now poses itself is: Should we invite foreign dignitaries to this joyous occasion, or shall we simply conclude that no other nation is fit to bask with us in our place in the sun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19010;All must see our splendor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19010;Our isolation is splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19015;Allies or Enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19015;Relations with one of our allies have cooled. Perhaps we should reconsider our alliance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19015;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19015;Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19017;Questioning Our Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19017;We have begun to question our alliance to a great power that is clearly not our true protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19017;Let us change this arrangement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19018;Alliance Broken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19018;A series of diplomatic blunders have broken our alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19018;Ah, blast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19019;But we really need that alliance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19020;$PROVINCENAME$ Botanical Expedition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19020;The flora of $PROVINCENAME$ is spectacular, unique and mostly unknown to science. Here, in the vast spaces of uncharted land, an untold affluence of botanical riches awaits the discoverer who dares brave the harsh and unforgiving climate in search of it. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Botanical Society is considering sending an expedition to $PROVINCENAME$, but, as is so often the case, funds are lacking. Sending an expedition could further the cause of science, but, beware, we might get competition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19020;Send the expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19020;We have better things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19022;$FROMPROVINCE$ Botanical Expedition??;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19022;Rumors abound in botanical circles that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has launched a botanical expedition to $FROMPROVINCE$. According to the rumors, the flora of $FROMPROVINCE$ is a veritable cornucopia of beauty and biological diversity. While $FROMPROVINCE$ is a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, we could attempt to send an expedition of our own. It might be frowned upon, but the discoveries we could make do have a strange allure of their own.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19022;Send a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ expedition!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19022;The province belongs to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19024;House Debate on Botany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19024;... and, yet, while some amongst our citizenry can't afford the bare minimums of food and clothing, our government spends wasteful millions on sending expeditions to God-forsaken corners of nowhere in search of colorful flowers!'\n\nA debate has broken out in the Upper House over the botanical expedition that we decided to fund some time ago. Liberals oppose the expenses that the expedition has accrued, claiming that $COUNTRYNAME$ can ill afford such luxuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19024;Abort the expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19024;The governments policy stands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19025;Botanical Expedition Reports Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19025;... thus, our expedition has now catalogued an additional 20 species of plantlife hereto unknown to science. During the past months two additional men have been claimed by the foul odors of malaria and dysentery, but, despite absent friends, morale among the men continues to be high. With best wishes, and love. Signed, ... '\n\nThe botanical expedition we dispatched has reported back. It is clear that, while they are making progress, they could use some additional support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19025;We support our boys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19025;Let's see if they can find any edible plants;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19026;Eaten by Cannibals?;Mang? par des cannibales ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19026;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Botanical Expedition that we dispatched some time ago hasn't been heard from in quite a while. Yesterday, we received a troubling report:\n\n'The camp is deserted. Scattered around the former camp grounds are trace remnants of what I believe to be signs of a struggle. Tracks lead farther away into the vast inhospitable hell beyond. I believe this to be the end of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Botanical Expedition of $YEAR$'\n\nIt seems our expedition has vanished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19026;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19027;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19027;The enormous white crown leaves of the flower shines with unrivaled luster. The botanical expedition we dispatched some time ago has returned home with a newly discovered flower. The flower, which is the size of the fist of a full grown man, has quickly become the talk of Europe, as gardeners all across the continent strive to cultivate it. In honor of the rich sponsorships we have provided our expedition the flower has been named 'The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empress'. Our scientific discovery is the envy of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19027;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19028;Botanical Expedition Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19028;$FROMCOUNTRY$ announced today that it has located the famed white flower that will henceforth be known as 'The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Empress'. In light of this discovery, our own botanical expedition has very limited outsights of finding anything that will rival the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ discovery. Our expedition has returned home, with limited success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19028;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19029;Expedition Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19029;The streets of $CAPITAL$ were decorated in spring flowers today in celebration of the returning botanical expedition of $YEAR$. The expedition has been an astounding success, having catalogued more than one hundred new species of colonial flora. Our nation can take pride in itself, and know that its efforts have helped further the cause of science!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19029;Yay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19355;Great Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19355;We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalog of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs – Victory in spite of all terrors – Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival. \n\nGrowing national pride in countries around the world has reached the point where people will not accept anything less than total victory when Great Powers clash. From now on, any conflict with at least two Great Powers on each side will be regarded as a Great War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19355;God help us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19365;The Restoration of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19365;An idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not? The people are urging our government to approach them for aid, though some within the government are concerned this could possibly alienate our ally as well, not to mention stir up new hostility with our neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19365;We will approach our protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19365;We will leave the matter alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19366;The Restoration of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19366;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands. With $COUNTRY_ADJ$ help, they say, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will prove a much worthier ally. There are those concerned with the trouble this might stir up, however. Should we look the other way, prove $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence has weight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19366;Tell them we shall consider it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19366;We cannot afford such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to consider our proposal. It's possible they will, in the end, take no military action on our behalf… it's come to our attention that relations between them and one of our neighbors has cooled severely, however, so a war may yet come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19367;Then there is hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to intervene on our behalf. Worse, it appears the purpose of our mission has leaked to at least one of our neighbors, angering them greatly bringing threats of war against $COUNTRY$. Did $FROMCOUNTRY$ inform them? Have we been abandoned by our ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19368;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19370;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Overlords;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19370;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers marched into $CAPITAL$ today, accompanying the new $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governor who will be overseeing the operation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ puppet government. Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again? Perhaps $COUNTRY$ has suffered enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19370;A sad day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME81002212;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Neutrality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC81002212;We have been pulled into an outside war, despite our dedication to neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA81002212;We must remain Neutral!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB81002212;We must discard our Neutrality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19356;A War To End All Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19356;It has become increasingly clear that we have entered a new era of unprecedented warfare. The conflicts of our time are no longer mere local issues, but instead reach every corner of the world. Considering the ever increasing stakes and the terrifying impact of these hostilities on the nations involved, there is no longer any need for restrain.\n\n From now on a great war will allow a side that is clearly winning the ability to add even more wargoals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19356;Gentlemen, all I ask for is war, a war so grand as to make Hell itself tremble;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	###Liberal Revolutions###

EVTNAME10001;The age of Liberalism is upon us!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10001;Long ago in europe a time known as the "spring time of nations" saw the face of europe changed in a series of revolutions bringing freedoms to the common man.\nNow the ideas of liberalism run rampant through $COUNTRYNAME$, how shall this shape the europe of today??;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10001;The people flock to this new ideology;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10000;Spring of Nations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10000;A wind of revolution blows, the storm is on the horizon. A fervor of liberalism sweeps through $COUNTRYNAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10000;You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10050;The End of The Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10050;Broken, busted and thrown to the sides lie the barricades, and the tricolors have stopped waving from the window sills. The events that will be recorded by history as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Liberal Revolution of $YEAR$ are all in the past, and it seems that we have managed to weather the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10050;We pray for the fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10100;The Great Famine of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10100;Phytophthora infestans, the dreaded potato blight, has struck one of our farming provinces. Starving smallholders, and in some places driving whole families from their homes, the potato blight has caused a localized famine that threatens to spread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10100;Let them eat cake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10100;Spare no effort in relieving the local farmers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10105;Potato Famine Debated;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10105;And while our people still labor under ghastly conditions in the fields, what has our government done to relieve the starving farmers affected this very year by the dreaded Potato blight? Economic freedom could allow for the import of ersatz foodstuffs, but privileges long established must, apparently, be maintained.'\n\nLiberal sympathizers have come out of the woodwork both locally and in parliament, criticizing our government for its inability to handle the Potato Blight that recently struck one of our provinces. If the liberals become too strong, they may very well conspire again to ferment revolution. We should also consider dispatching troops to provinces where we see Liberal Agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10105;Suppress them in parliament and hope that the countryside stays calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10105;Let them have their say in parliament, and the effects might dissipate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10110;The Watch on $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10110;Fast and true stands the guard in $CAPITAL$, at least if a local poet is to be believed. A poetical pamphlet decrying the state of our nation, its political backwardness and oppression, has inflamed feelings in one of our states. All around $COUNTRY$ cries for national unity can be heard, as liberals take to the streets protesting the old order, calling for national unification with our cultural brethren in other countries, and a liberalization of our political system. We should consider dispatching troops to provinces where Liberal Agitation is present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10110;Bloody revolutionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10110;The old order must be defended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10120;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Herald;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10120;A new daily has begun circulating in $COUNTRY$. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Herald, carrying hard-hitting political commentary, literary critique and local news, has quickly developed into a flagship for local liberal politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10120;Allow it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10120;Censor the paper;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10130;Chartist Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10130;A local chapter of the Chartist Society, calling for a broadening of the voting franchise, and an end to landed voting rights, has opened in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10130;Oh great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10130;Suppress the society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10140;Secret Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10140;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $COUNTRY$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society, forced into hiding due to the persecution of any legitimate opposition to the ruling party. Whether it be the Rosicrucian's or the Illuminati, these society members will continue to act from the shadows until $COUNTRY$ allows free debate and opposition in its politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10140;...maybe that is what they want us to think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10140;Pass a local ordnance against it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10150;Luddite Mob;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10150;The smog from the factories hangs low against the blood red of a charcoal sky. Far away in the depths of the city, in the deepest bowels of the industrial machine, the cries and shouts of a forming mob can be heard echoing against a backdrop of drainpipes and smokestacks. Infuriated over poor working conditions, clamoring for a return to a lost pastoral dream remembered, Luddites take to the streets in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10150;Send in the troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10150;Hint at policy changesv
EVTNAME10155;Pan-Nationalist Fervor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10155;A fervor has been sweeping through parts of $COUNTRY$, with liberal-minded revolutionaries calling for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens to rise up and demand the unification of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$. They have begun waving $UNION_ADJ$ flags in the streets, fomenting riots and violence. The police have had difficulties dealing with the problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10155;Long live $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10160;Banquet Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10160;Immorality is like water, flowing through every conceivable crack in the dams of legal authority. Liberals in $COUNTRY$ have, on account of the ban on public meetings, begun holding banquets. Ostensibly without purpose -- A gathering among friends, a celebration, a feast -- the common knowledge secret that no one dare pronounce is that these banquets are political meetings carried out behind a thin veneer of legality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10160;Time to crack down on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB10160;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10170;Liberal Agitation Spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10170;Like rats carrying contagious diseases, the preachers of modernity move effortlessly back and forth across our borders. Liberal agitation has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighboring province and is now threatening to inflame the entire state. We might want to send some troops here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10170;We shall consider it;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10180;Anti-Jacobin Tract;Tract antijacobin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10180;In a time when the forces of revolution threaten to overthrow all the long-established orders of Europe, it becomes our sacred duty to voice our dissent. The Jacobins -- holding nothing sacred save the profane -- are charlatans peddling false ideologies. What Robespierre's terror brought to France, their radicalism now threatens to impose on $COUNTRY$.'\n\nThe widespread liberal agitation in $COUNTRY$ has mobilized the forces of reaction, and a leading conservative intellectual has published an Anti-Jacobin tract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA10180;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10190;Fiery Sermon in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10190;And let it be known, that those who argue the cause of revolution argue against the cause and design of almighty God himself. For he, in his wisdom, has made kingdoms on earth, and set kings to rule over them.'\n\nA local preacher in $PROVINCENAME$ has held a fiery sermon condemning several liberal causes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME10200;Liberal Insurrection in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10200;'Death to the $MONARCHTITLE$!', a hoarse voice cries. The streets in $PROVINCENAME$ have come alive. A local injustice, or the perception of one, have animated the unwashed masses into rebellion against our rule and threatens to spread to the rest of the state. The revolt is still small enough that its future course has not been set in stone, and leniency might avert it, but perhaps it is best to put our foot down firmly to set an example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME10205;Fighting in the Streets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10205;Tensions in one of our provinces reached a boiling point recently, with liberals and reactionaries battling in the streets. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police were quick to move in, but tempers remain high and already there are reports of fighting elsewhere in the state. Officials are calling for decisive action to put an end to the violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC10215;Nationalists in $COUNTRY$, inspired by the wave of liberalism in a neighboring nation, have risen up.

EVTDESC10170_NEW;Like rats carrying contagious diseases, the preachers of modernity move effortlessly back and forth across our borders. Liberal agitation has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighboring province and is now threatening to inflame the entire state. We might want to send some troops here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC10220;The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that $PROVINCENAME$ was, up until just recently, a hot-bed of liberal agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is a Sans-culotte, the iconographic personification of the French revolution, holding a republican tricolor. The pamphlet reads: 'Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood -- $COUNTRY$'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came.;Le bruit de la pluie tombant sur la place d?erte est assourdissant. Une brochure en lambeaux, jet? dans le caniveau - l'encre d?oulinante ?travers le papier de douceur fleur bleu?re - est la seule chose qui montre encore aujourd'hui en preuve que $PROVINCENAME$ a ?? jusqu'?tout r?emment, un foyer d'agitation lib?ale. Repr?ent?sur la brochure 'un sans-culotte', la personnification iconographique de la R?olution fran?ise, tenant un drapeau tricolore r?ublicain. La brochure se lit comme suit: ?ibert? Egalit? Fraternit?- $COUNTRY$. Elle est bient? balay? par la pluie et tombe dans les ?outs d'o?elle est venue. ;Das Prasseln des Regens auf dem verlassenen Platz ist ohrenbet?bend. Ein verknittertes Pamphlet, in den Rinnstein geworfen -- die Tinte bildet weiche bl?liche Bl?en auf dem Papier -- ist das einzige, das noch davon zeugt, dass $PROVINCENAME$ bis vor kurzem noch eine Brutst?te liberaler Agitation war. Auf dem Pamphlet ist die ikonografische Personifizierung der Franz?ischen Revolution abgebildet, eine Sans-culotte mit einer Trikolore in der Hand. Auf dem Pamphlet steht: 'Freiheit, Gleichheit, Br?erlichkeit -- $COUNTRY$'. Schon bald w?cht der Regen es fort, hinunter in die Kanalisation und den Untergrund, aus dem es kam.;;El sonido de la lluvia sobre la plaza desierta es ensordecedor. La tinta se diluye en tonos azulados por los bordes de un manoseado panfleto que est?tirado en la alcantarilla es la ?ica prueba que resta de que, hasta hace poco, $PROVINCENAME$ fue un fuerte n?leo de agitaci? liberal. En el panfleto aparece un Sans-culotte, la representaci? iconogr?ica de la revoluci? francesa, sosteniendo una bandera tricolor republicana. El panfleto dice: 'Libertad, Igualdad y Fraternidad para $COUNTRY$'. Pronto, es arrastrado por la lluvia hacia las alcantarillas de las que sali?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
